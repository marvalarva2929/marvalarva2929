### Competitive Programming

In regards to competitive programming, you can see my codeforces profile here: https://codeforces.com/profile/marvalarva2929.

I'm also ranked Silver in USACO (http://usaco.org/), an extremely prestigious competitive programming competition! 

### Robotics

I'm also heavily involved in Robotics, specifically FRC Team 5417. First robotics holds - and will always hold ðŸ’– - a special place in my heart because it's what originally got me interested in Computer Science. I'd like to specifically thank FTC Team 7252 for the spark of passion they started in my life - a spark that has slowly grown into a wildfire and that I predict will soon consume me :D

### Personal Projects

To me, Computer Science is an art, and I beleive everyone should have an opportunity to use it to express their creativity. It's why I started the "Inclusive Computing Initiative", a project that aims to give children with mental disabilities access to Computer Science education. You can learn more on our webiste at: https://inclusivecompute.org/

I'm also the Vice President of Communications at Toys For Texans, an entirely student-led non-profit organization. I've been a part of it for over a year and I've witnessed it's growth as our revenues have skyrocketed and our impact has grown. We're currently the largest highschool-student run non-profit-organization in North Texans, and it's a group I'm proud to be in. It's my dearest hope that it inspires you to make a change in your world. Learn more about us at https://www.toysfortexans.org/.
